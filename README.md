# Assignment


Î¥ou have a database with this structure

rental
- name
- type = standalone_rental OR room_type OR room
- parent_rental = rental_id

booking
- parent_rental
- rental
- check_in_date
- check_out_date

We want an api without any authorization that will return the availability of rentals of type 'standalone_rental' OR 'room_type' based on two dates.

I, the consumer of the api, want to know what are the available standalone_rentals or room_types I can book for a given date range.

- Feel free to start the script with some fixtures or an sql import so we have some data.
- Don't worry about a lot of data. Even 3-4 rentals and 3-4 bookings are enough. As long as it works.
- structure of the request and response, urls are up to you. They are part of the assignment.
- you can complete this in any language you want

Some explanation on the type of rental.

standalone_rental = a house, a villa. Something you rent as a whole.
room_type = think of type of room in a hotel. "three bed" "grand suite". When you book a hotel you never book room 703. You book a "double bed room". This is the "double_bed_room"
room = this is the room 703. This is never visible to the client that wants to book

So in our case, the bookings are assigned to standalone_rentals (rental is the standalone and parent_rental can be the same) or to room (rental = room and parent_rental = room_type).
